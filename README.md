### Overview
This project implements a deep learning-based computer vision system to automatically detect early-stage oral abnormalities from clinical mouth images. The goal is binary classification: determining whether an image shows a healthy oral cavity or signs of a potentially harmful lesion.

---

### Environment Setup
For the portal to run, python packages will be required .This whole portal is build on python3.11 so the required packages are mentioned in a file named as requirements.txt from where we can download all the required libraries in a single go by just typing the following command in the command prompt after installing python.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### About the Dataset
This project utilizes the Oral Cancer Image Dataset from Kaggle, which contains a collection of labeled clinical images representing both healthy oral cavities and those with visible lesions. The dataset is well-balanced, making it suitable for training deep learning models for binary classification.

Curated to support research in automated oral lesion detection, the dataset provides high-quality images that facilitate the development of accurate and reliable diagnostic tools. It serves as a valuable resource for advancing early detection and intervention techniques in oral healthcare through machine learning and computer vision.

### Development Workflow
1. Update config.yaml – Define file paths, model configurations, and directory structure
2. Update params.yaml – Set model training parameters such as image size, learning rate, batch size, etc.
3. Update Entity Classes – Define structured data models using Python dataclasses
4. Update Configuration Manager (src/cnnClassifier/config) – Read and validate configurations
5. Update Components – Implement core logic like data ingestion, model creation, training, and evaluation
6. Update Pipeline Stages – Connect components to form modular pipeline stages
7. Update main.py – Run all pipeline stages sequentially using a central controller
8. Update dvc.yaml – Define and version the DVC pipeline for reproducibility
9. Update or Run app.py – Launch the Flask web application for image-based predictions
